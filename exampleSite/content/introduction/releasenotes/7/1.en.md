## 7.1.0 (xxxx-xx-xx) {#7-1-0}

### Change

- {{% badge style="note" title=" " %}}Change{{% /badge %}} The sidebar menus are now [completely configurable](configuration/sidebar/menus).

  This is provided by the new parameter `sidebarmenus`. With the new system, you can

  - show arbitrary amounts of menus
  - set headings for each menu
  - base it on your page structure or use Hugo's menu feature
  - configure a starting page if a menu is based on page structure
  - display unlimited nesting for both menu types
  - reconfigure the menus in a page's front matter
  - apply the usual parameter `alwaysopen`, `collapsibleMenu`, etc. for all menu types

  You don't need to change anything in your existing installation as the old configuration is used as a default.
